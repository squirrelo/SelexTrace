Current pathway:
1) Run clean_seqs to clean up the sequences. Make sure it is organized exactly as it is in the Ely_selection folder with The folder R1, R2, R3, etc holding the files generated for each round. 
2)Run pick_otus.py from Qiime at 99% on the round's CleanStripped.fasta file. 
3)Run the pickotu_to_fasta.py script to get the fasta files for each cluster
4)Run OTU_to_infernal_rnaforester.py with the cluster_paths.txt generated by pickotu_to_fasta as the -i input and the folder containing the R1, R2, R3 etc. folders as the -f input
5)Check overlaps in sequences found by infernal using ovelap_check.py
6) Run remove_infernal_seqs_rounds.py to remove seqs found by infernal from the rounds.
