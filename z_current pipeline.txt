Current pathway:
1) Run clean_seqs to clean up the sequences. This can be done directly on the fastq files. Make sure they are in the proper naming convention and folder layout before running.
2)run clusters_to_infernal_shapes_bayesfold.py over the cleaned sequences. Make sure you are feeding it the unique sequences with 2+ copies for -i argument.
5)Check overlaps in sequences found by infernal using ovelap_check.py
6) Run remove_infernal_seqs_rounds.py to remove seqs found by infernal from the rounds.
